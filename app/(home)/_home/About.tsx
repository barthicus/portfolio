        I&apos;mÂ Software EngineerÂ from Krotoszyn, Poland, working mostly in <strong>web development</strong>. I enjoy
        turning complex problems into performant and beautiful applications. Recently, I&apos;ve been designing web
        applications for medical clinics from United States like <strong>video-call solutions</strong>,{' '}
        <strong>live events CRMs</strong>, and orders management applications.

        For my upcoming projects, I prefer to choose <ExternalLink href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</ExternalLink> with{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</ExternalLink> and{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</ExternalLink>. I also rely on{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</ExternalLink> for hosting and{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://neon.tech">NeonDB</ExternalLink> for the database. When it comes to the UI,{' '}

        Family is everything to me so I spend most of my free time with my two kids and my lovely wife. Outside of that,
        I really enjoy cooking, running and calisthenics. If I can I really like watching esports matches while cheering
        for my favorite teams.
