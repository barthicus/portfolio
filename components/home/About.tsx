        I&apos;mÂ Software EngineerÂ from Krotoszyn, Poland, working mostly in <strong>web development</strong>. I enjoy
        turning complex problems into performant and beautiful applications. Lately I was working on web applications
        for medical clinics from United States like <strong>video-call solutions</strong>,
        <strong>virtual tradeshow CRMs</strong> and covid pass applications.

        For my next projects, I prefer to choose <ExternalLink href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</ExternalLink> with{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</ExternalLink> and{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</ExternalLink>. I&apos;m also using{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</ExternalLink> for hosting and{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://planetscale.com">Planetscale</ExternalLink> for the database. When it comes to the
        UI, <ExternalLink href="https://figma.com">Figma</ExternalLink> is my choice for designing and prototyping.

        Family is everything to me so I spend most of my free time with my two kids and my lovely wife. Outside of that,
        I really enjoy cooking, running and calisthenics. If I can I really like watching esports matches while cheering
        for my favorite teams.
